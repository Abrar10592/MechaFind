# MechFind

Connecting drivers in Bangladesh to instant, reliable roadside assistance.

Countless drivers across Bangladesh face vulnerability and stress when their vehicles break down in unfamiliar locations—especially at night or in rural areas where existing roadside services rarely reach. Most solutions require memberships or fail to connect users with verified local mechanics, leaving drivers stranded, unsafe, and anxious. **MechFind** bridges this critical gap by offering an inclusive platform for instant help, reducing response times, and increasing road safety for everyone.
